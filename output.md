**topic:** "Lee Harris' Engagement" 

**summary:** Lee Harris was looking for a way to increase engagement in their community, but the API did not provide the user's last login date. Tim Abbott suggested that Lee Harris search for the API documentation at https://zulip.com/api/get-presence, which may provide the information they are looking for without having to pull every message and emoji reaction. Lee Harris realized that the nomenclature "Presence" combined with the zulip client's "more than 2 weeks" presentation of older presence had thrown them off the scent.

**topic:** Investigating OpenAPI Issue #22938 

**summary:** Lauryn Menard investigated issue #22938, which was a typo in OpenAPI documentation causing the security scheme defined in `zulip.yaml` to fail tests due to an update from OpenAPI 2.0 to 3.0.1. Lauryn found that the 3rd party openapi_core validation was not recognizing the Django authorization header set for the test's request (`"HTTP_AUTHORIZATION"`) and instead was looking for `"Authorization"` to compare against the security scheme. Tim Abbott offered to explain the detail if needed, noting that the `api_` functions do API authentication: Passing an email/api-key pair via HTTP basic authentication, while the `client_` functions use the current browser session, requiring a call to `self.login()` first. Tim also mentioned that the `api_` functions are generally nicer to use, in that doing an API request as user X via those functions works the same whether or not the caller logged in as a different user or whatever, and that one generally doesn't want to write a test helper that calls `self.login`, since it would create a confusing side effect when reading the code of the caller.

**summary:** Lauryn Menard noticed that the OpenAPI documentation was failing tests due to a capitalization typo. After further investigation, she found that the Django authorization header was not being correctly validated in the OpenAPI 3.0.1 update. Tim Abbott then explained that the `api_` functions use HTTP basic authentication, while the `client_` functions use the current browser session. He also noted that the validator is used to verify requests/responses for the parallel `/json/` URLs used by browsers, which are not intended for end users.

Tim Abbott suggested that Angel de Vicente check if Zulip was open in a browser tab in addition to the desktop app, as the "Do Not Disturb" feature only affects the desktop app and not the web application. Angel de Vicente reported that they were using ArchLinux, running `Zulip-5.9.5-x86_64.AppImage` and that their colleague had also confirmed that in the Mac Desktop App they were still receiving visual notifications despite "Do Not Disturb" being activated, further suggesting that this is a bug.

He is asking if there should be a separate row in the 'Notifications triggers' table for the '@topic mention' feature, which would allow users to configure email/push/desktop/audible notifications for it. Abhijeet Bodas suggested that for v1, it would be fine to have a single setting for `@all`, `@everyone` and `@topic`, which is the setting which they have right now, so that no new rows/columns need to be added to the matrix. Alya Abbott agreed with this suggestion, and the behavior of the feature would be similar to '@all', but the users to be notified would be limited to the participants of the topic. He is asking which of the two is the expected behavior here, and has cc'd Tim Abbott, Alya Abbott|19257, and Abhijeet Bodas.

He did some tweaks to remove the undo button and the default timeout of 4s, and proposed a version with a loading indicator, which was a gif of a feedback widget with a loading spinner. Tim Abbott suggested adding a loading spinner on the widget using the `loading.js` library, rendered much larger than normal, and proposed having a minimum time interval for which this will be shown, to handle cases when there are too few unreads. He also suggested using the Chrome "Performance" tool to debug the issue by trying with ~1K messages and suggested that the frontend code may be O(N^2) or worse when processing very large numbers of "newly read" messages, and proposed that they figure out what the

To show the user that the app is working on it, they are experimenting with a navbar alert and a feedback widget with a loading indicator. After testing with a few thousand unreads, they encountered a problem with the loading indicator freezing. Aryan Shridhar tested the PR locally and was unable to reproduce the bug, but when they tried with ~10,000 unreads, the loading spinner froze and the browser threw a popup. Tim Abbott suggested using the Chrome Performance tool to debug the issue, as it is likely that there is some frontend code that is O(N^2) or worse when processing large numbers of "newly read" messages.

**topic:** Neil Pilgrim's findings 

**summary:** Neil Pilgrim noticed that there is no documentation for when the `prev_stream` feature was added to the /api/get-message-history API. He believes that the feature was added in Zulip 3.0, which would match the difference in source between 2.1 and 3.4. Lauryn Menard said that looking back at the commits in #21309 (feature level 118), it seems that `prev_stream` wasn't documented in the API until those changes. She also found that when the API changelog was added (at feature level 2 for Zulip 3.0), the `prev_stream` field existed in `actions.py` for the message edit history. Reading the API changelog note for feature level 118, she can see why it might not be clear that the `prev_stream` existed prior to that feature level. Lauryn Menard also found that the `prev_stream` commit had not yet been merged in Zulip 2.1.0 and noted that the endpoint for getting a message's edit history was there at feature level 1 as well.

**summary:** Brijmohan Siyag is proposing to add a link preview feature for Github, with the related Issue #19710, PR #22368 and CZO. The current URL endpoint is 'previewable', but may be proposed to be changed to 'previewable_url'. Authentication is required to access the endpoint, and any other suggestions are welcome. The API employs basic authentication, however, it may need to be reconsidered. Earlier, Brijmohan implemented a prototype which had a button in org settings to authorize Zulip's Github App, this way they will have 5000 requests per hour for each org and access to their private repos also, so rate limit will not be an issue initially. It is initially implemented for Github issues and pull requests, and takes care of linkifiers. The links it supports are of the type ((http(s)://)(www.)github.com/zulip/zulip/(issues|pull)/19710). The Zulip client passes a URL to the server in the request, and the server responds with data from Github, including fields such as `type`, `platform`, `owner`, `repo`, `issue number`, `author`, `title`, `
